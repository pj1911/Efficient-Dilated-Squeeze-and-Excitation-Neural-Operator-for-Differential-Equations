# Efficient-Dilated-Squeeze-and-Excitation-Neural-Operator-for-Differential-Equations
D-SENO is a lightweight neural operator for fast, accurate PDE surrogates. It combines dilated convolution blocks (wide receptive fields) with squeeze-excitation modules (channel recalibration) to capture long-range physics efficiently. Achieves up to ~20× faster training while matching/outperforming prior methods.
